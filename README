AKSystemSound

Simplifies playing caf audio files using AudioServicesPlaySystemSound.
Audio files can also be scheduled to be played with a specified interval.

Convert files to caf using afconvert:
afconvert -f caff -d LEI16 [input] out.caf

Usage
Play once:
[[AKSystemSound soundWithName:@"ping"] play];

Schedule:
soundID = [[AKSystemSound soundWithName:@"ping"] scheduleWithInterval:5];

Unschedule:
[AKSystemSound cancelScheduledSoundWithID:soundID];
soundID = AKSystemSoundInvalidID;

Good to have if you have any other audio playback (AudioQueue etc)
and need to temporarily lower the output volume from that.
