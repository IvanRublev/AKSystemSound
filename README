AKSystemSound

Simplifies playing caf audio files using AudioServicesPlaySystemSound.
Audio files can also be scheduled to be played with a specified interval.

Convert files to caf using afconvert:
afconvert -f caff -d LEI16 [input] out.caf

Usage
Play once:
[[AKSystemSound soundWithName:@"ping"] play];

Schedule repeated playback:
soundID = [[AKSystemSound soundWithName:@"ping"] scheduleRepeatWithInterval:5];

Schedule playback in delta time:
soundID = [[AKSystemSound soundWithName:@"ping"] schedulePlayInInterval:5];

Schedule playback at specified date:
soundID = [[AKSystemSound soundWithName:@"ping"] schedulePlayAtDate:date];

Unschedule:
[AKSystemSound unscheduleSoundID:soundID];
soundID = AKSystemSoundInvalidID;

AKSystemSoundsWillPlay-/AKSystemSoundsDidPlayNotification

Good to have if you have any other audio playback (AudioQueue etc)
and need to temporarily lower the output volume from that.

AKSystemSoundWillPlay-/AKSystemSoundDidPlayNotification
